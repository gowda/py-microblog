# py-microblog
Microblogging application from
[Ruby on Rails Tutorial, 3rd Edition](http://3rd-edition.railstutorial.org/)
implemented using `python` & [`flask`](http://flask.pocoo.org/).

### Development Setup
It is convenient to use virtual `python` environment for the application. `virtualenv` helps us in creating and managing virtual environments. Install `virtualenv` using `pip`, if not already installed:
```bash
$ pip install virtualenv
```

Virtual `python` environment is a directory & can be created anywhere. To create a virtual environment in current directory:
```bash
$ virtualenv env
```

Activate the created virtual environment:
```bash
$ source env/bin/activate
```
