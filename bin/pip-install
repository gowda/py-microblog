# pip-install
#
# enhance 'pip' to save the installed package into requirements tracking file
#
# Usage:
#   ./pip-install <package-name>
#
# Known issues:
#   1. If the same package is added twice, then requirements tracking file will
#      have two entries for the package. Installing again will result in three
#      entries.
#   2. All packages with name containing <package-name> string will also be
#      appended to requirements tracking file.
#      For example,
#        $ ./pip-install flask-oauthlib
#        $ ./pip-install flask
#
#        $ cat requirements.txt
#        Flask-OAuthlib==0.9.3
#        Flask==0.11.1
#        Flask-OAuthlib==0.9.3
